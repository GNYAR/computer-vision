# Homework #1

Apply at least four image operations, such as gray-level mapping, histogram equalization, and high/low pass filtering, to the test video.

Create results with audio and visual representation similar to the demo video.

Use some Python libraries, such as `pyttsx3` and `MoviePy`, to automatically add voiceovers and subtitles for the demo video.

## Basic Requirements
