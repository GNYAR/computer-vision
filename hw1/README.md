# Homework 1

Apply at least four image operations, such as gray-level mapping, histogram equalization, and high/low pass filtering, to the test video.

Create results with audio and visual representation similar to the demo video.

Use some Python libraries, such as `pyttsx3` and `MoviePy`, to automatically add voiceovers and subtitles for the demo video.

## Basic Requirements

- At least one of the image operations must apply the operation, which converts the color image between different color coordinate systems.
- At least one of the image operations must be implemented by tensorflow or keras or pytorch.
- At least one of the image operations must apply to the first 9 seconds of the YouTube video [聖稜-雪山的脊樑 ©](https://youtu.be/PHqhEgkGfrs).
